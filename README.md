# Algebraic Topology

In Winter 2021, I taught a semester-long course at UWO on Algebraic Topology aimed at graduate students and upper-level undergrads.
The main textbook for the course was [Hatcher](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html) but I rarely used the book at all.
The course covered the fundamental group, covering spaces, and singular homology.
